        <p class="about-text">
          Hi, I'm <span class="about-bold"> Anthony-Paul Fontana</span> - a
          recent Computer Engineering Technology Honours graduate from Humber
          College in Etobicoke, Ontario. During my time at Humber I learned a
          variety of skills such as, hardware and software, electronics and
          networking. Software is what intrigued me the most and I got to learn
          multiple languages and technologies. Some of these languages and
          technologies include: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Python, Java, C,
          Bootstrap, MySQL, PHP and Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
          <br /><br />
          Two of my favourite projects I have built are a solar panel tracker
          and a covid security system. The Solar panel tracker was coded in C
          and utilizes a Raspberry PI 3 along with multiple hardware components.
          The purpose of the project was to get the software and hardware to
          work together so that the solar panel could track the sun. Next, the
          Covid Security System was a group capstone project that had 2 parts
          that worked together. The first part was, an Android application that
          was coded in Java using the Android studio IDE. The application used
          the firebase database to display information based on the specific
          user that was logged in. The second part was the hardware, a Raspberry
          PI, a custom PCB and 4 sensors were used for this. The sensors worked
          together to check if the person using the device had a fever. If a
          fever was not detected, the information would get sent to the database
          and a motor would unlock a door. If a fever was detected the
          information would not only get logged, but an admin on the app would
          get notified about it and the motor would keep the door locked.
          <br /><br />
          A little about me personally. I enjoy sports, I played both hockey, as
          a goalie, and football, as an offensive lineman, growing up and my
          favourite teams are the Montreal Canadiens and the Green Bay Packers.
