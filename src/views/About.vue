        <p class="about-text">
          Hi, I'm <span class="about-bold"> Anthony-Paul Fontana</span> - a
          recent Computer Engineering Technology Honours graduate from Humber
          College in Etobicoke, Ontario. During my time at Humber I learned a
          variety of skills such as, hardware and software, electronics and
          networking. Software is what intrigued me the most and I got to learn
          multiple languages and technologies. Some of these languages and
          technologies include: HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Vue.js, Python, Java, C,
          Bootstrap, MySQL, PHP and Object Oriented Programming (OOP).
          <br /><br />
          Two of my favourite projects I have built are a solar panel tracker
          and a Covid Security System. The solar panel tracker was coded in C
          and utilized a Raspberry PI 3 along with multiple hardware components.
          Next, the Covid Security System was a group capstone project, which
          had two parts that worked in unison. The first part was an Android
          application that was coded in Java using the Android Studio IDE. The
          application used the firebase database to display information based on
          the specific user that was logged in. The second part was the
          hardware, a Raspberry PI 3, a custom PCB, and 4 sensors were used for
          this. The sensors worked together to check if the person using it was
          safe to enter the building. All the information from the sensors got
          uploaded to firebase to be displayed on the app.
          <br /><br />
          A little about me personally. I enjoy sports, I played both hockey, as
          a goalie, and football, as an offensive lineman, growing up and my
          favourite teams are the Montreal Canadiens and the Green Bay Packers.
